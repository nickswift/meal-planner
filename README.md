# Meal Planner

This is a simple python based tool for creating and organizing 
meal plans.

## Goals

Note: this list may change over time.

* Add recipes to a storage backend
* Retrieve recipes from a storage backend so they can be displayed or printed
* Create weekly meal plans with some heuristic for efficient grocery shopping
* Display shopping list in an easily printable format

## Stretch Goals

* Turn meal plans into calendar events for all major calendar apps
* (maybe) pull this logic out into a Go based API or something like that
* Make a web UI for interacting with this system (using aforementioned API)
